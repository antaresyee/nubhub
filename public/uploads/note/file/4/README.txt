# COMPSCI 210 Confidential Peer Assessment for Labs
####################################################

In order to receive credit for Lab/Project 3, you must submit an individual 
confidential peer assessment by Wednesday Dec 5th, 11:59 p.m. Please use 
label "lab4" when submitting this lab.

Write the names of all of your team members (including yourself!) for all the
three group labs/projects (Lab1b: Devil Shell; Lab2: EventBarrier, Elevator;
Lab3: DeFiler) in this course. Check the format provided towards the end of the
file.

Assign an evaluation to each team member (including yourself!) for his/her
performance across all of the semester's group projects. The possible
evaluations are:

    Excellent: Consistently displayed leadership, creativity, and capability;
    could always be counted on to do his/her fair share of the work or more.  

    Satisfactory: Usually did what s/he was supposed to do; acceptably
    prepared and cooperative. I would happily work with this person again.  

    Other: Did not meet the expectations/could not really be counted on/
    contributions are insignificant. If you would like to provide a few 
    sentences of clarification, that would be fine, but it is not essential.

Note: This is a chance to acknowledge your teammates who went "above and
beyond," or who did their fair share despite adverse circumstances--it's not
simply an opportunity to whine and finger-point. Generous recognition of the
contributions of teammates is always welcome. It puts us in a cheery mood as we
grade exams.

assessment levels accurately capture my views).

# External resources or collaboration involved
###############################################

List any external resources you used (other than material we provided) or you
found to be useful.

For the most part, our group primarily used the resources provided by the instructors.
Often we would check StackOverflow or more generally Google in order to figure
out aspects that were language specific but we did not often look to other materials
when it came to the concepts that were being targeted by the labs.


Also list any external collaborators involved (other than the instructors and
your team members) while completing your labs.

There were no other external collaborators to my recollection.
